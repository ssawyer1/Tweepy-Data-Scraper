# Tweepy-Data-Scraper
This program written in Python will use the Tweepy API by Twitter, to scrape the data of users all across Twitter in the last two weeks. It will store their data in .json files then visualize two networks. One network of users for COVID-19 vaccine and one network of users against COVID-19 vaccinations. It will also calculate three network measures from the two networks and display them in graph form. Those measures being degree centrality, diameter, and density. From these findings we can see who these users follow and if they who share the same views on COVID-19 have similar interests on Twitter.
